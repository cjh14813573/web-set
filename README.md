##the main page of webserver with all the authorities including looking through the status of rtu, changing the configuration, backing up and upgrading
####09, AUG, 2016
####the rtu status and com information is based on /app/WEBinfo.ini, directly write chinese characters in UTF-8. The files permitted to backup is listed in help.html which you can find in repository named webserver. The progress bar of upgrading is just a faked one only used to remind users that the web page is still working, for the reason that we could not achieve a real one using BOA.
